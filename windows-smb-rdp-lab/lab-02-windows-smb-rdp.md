# 🔐 Lab 02 – Windows SMB & RDP
**Cyber Fundamentals | Windows Basics**

---

## 🎯 Lab Objective
The objective of this lab is to understand how **SMB (Server Message Block)** and **RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)** are used in Windows environments for **remote access, authentication, and lateral movement**.

This lab demonstrates how credentials discovered through SMB can be leveraged to gain further access using PsExec and RDP.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered
- SMB file sharing and authentication
- Mapping and unmapping network shares
- Credential switching limitations in Windows
- PsExec remote command execution
- RDP authentication and Network Level Authentication (NLA)
- Credential-based lateral movement

---

## 🖥️ Lab Environment

| Machine | Role | Notes |
|------|----|----|
| Client | Starting machine | Used for SMB, PsExec, and RDP |
| Host 1 | SMB Host | Contains shared files and admin access |
| Host 2 | RDP Host | Target system for RDP access |

## 1️. Server Message Block (SMB)

SMB is a Windows network protocol that allows:
- File and folder sharing
- Printer sharing
- Remote administrative access
- Interaction with system resources

SMB operates **without a graphical interface** and is commonly used by both administrators and attackers.

---

## 2️. Connecting to SMB Shares

SMB shares can be accessed using Windows Explorer or the command line.



## Managing SMB Sessions

Map a share:

net use Z: \\<IP>\Share /user:username password


Remove all sessions:

net use * /delete

---
## Windows allows only one active SMB session per host.

###3️. SMB Versions
Version	Notes
SMBv1	Insecure, guest access
SMBv2	Improved security
SMBv3	Encryption & strongest

###4️. PsExec
PsExec allows remote command execution over SMB.

PsExec64.exe -i -accepteula \\<IP> -u admin -p <password> cmd
Used when:

- RDP is blocked
- Admin access is available

---

###5️. Credential Discovery

Credential files discovered via SMB enabled:

- PsExec access
- Further enumeration
- Discovery of RDP credentials

---

###6️. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)

- RDP provides full graphical access.
- Requires valid credentials
- Requires RDP permissions
- Uses Network Level Authentication (NLA)

---

###7️. Network Level Authentication (NLA)

NLA:
- Authenticates before session creation
- Prevents unauthorized access
- Reduces attack surface

---

## Lateral Movement Summary

- SMB access exposed credentials

- PsExec enabled admin command execution

- RDP credentials discovered

- RDP access to second host achieved

- Sensitive files retrieved

## Key Takeaways

- SMB is a powerful attack surface

- Admin ≠ RDP access

- Credentials are often stored insecurely

- Lateral movement is step-by-step

## One-Line Summary

SMB enables file and command access, PsExec enables remote execution, and RDP enables full desktop access—each requiring proper credentials and authentication context.

##Revision Notes

- Clear SMB sessions with net use * /delete

- PsExec uses SMB, not RDP

- RDP requires correct user + permissions

- Always verify which host you are connecting to
